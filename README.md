## Welcome to my home page.

I'm a software engineer and dog rescuer in Cary, North Carolina :)

I develop open source software at [Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com/). I'm currently working on (Red Hat Virtualization)[https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/virtualization/enterprise-virtualization]. I love open source software, and I'm very fortunate and grateful that this is my career.

Computers and technology are my main hobby. I enjoy playing with home automation, security cameras, and other geeky things. I also enjoy building just about anything, whether it's an electronics project or home improvement.

My wife Candace and I also run a small senior dog rescue, and we currently have 11 wonderful rescue dogs in our home! Please visit and like our Facebook page, [Simba's Seniors Dog Sanctuary](https://www.facebook.com/simbasseniors).
